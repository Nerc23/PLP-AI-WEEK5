Part 1: Short Answer Questions (30 points)

1. Problem Definition (6 points)

Define a hypothetical AI problem (e.g., "Predicting student dropout rates").

ListÂ 3 objectivesÂ andÂ 2 stakeholders.

ProposeÂ 1 Key Performance Indicator (KPI)Â to measure success.

2. Data Collection & Preprocessing (8 points)

IdentifyÂ 2 data sourcesÂ for your problem.

ExplainÂ 1 potential biasÂ in the data.

OutlineÂ 3 preprocessing stepsÂ (e.g., handling missing data, normalization).

3. Model Development (8 points)

Choose a model (e.g., Random Forest, Neural Network) and justify your choice.

Describe how you would split data into training/validation/test sets.

NameÂ 2 hyperparametersÂ you would tune and why.

4. Evaluation & Deployment (8 points)

SelectÂ 2 evaluation metricsÂ and explain their relevance.

What isÂ concept drift? How would you monitor it post-deployment?

DescribeÂ 1 technical challengeÂ during deployment (e.g., scalability).

Part 2: Case Study Application (40 points)

Scenario:Â A hospital wants an AI system to predict patient readmission risk within 30 days of discharge.

Tasks:

Problem Scope (5 points):Â Define the problem, objectives, and stakeholders.

Data Strategy (10 points):

Propose data sources (e.g., EHRs, demographics).

IdentifyÂ 2 ethical concernsÂ (e.g., patient privacy).

Design a preprocessing pipeline (include feature engineering steps).

Model Development (10 points):

Select a model and justify it.

Create a confusion matrix and calculate precision/recall (hypothetical data).

Deployment (10 points):

Outline steps to integrate the model into the hospitalâ€™s system.

How would you ensure compliance with healthcare regulations (e.g., HIPAA)?

Optimization (5 points):Â ProposeÂ 1 methodÂ to address overfitting.

Part 3: Critical Thinking (20 points)

Ethics & Bias (10 points):

How might biased training data affect patient outcomes in the case study?

SuggestÂ 1 strategyÂ to mitigate this bias.

Trade-offs (10 points):

Discuss the trade-off between model interpretability and accuracy in healthcare.

If the hospital has limited computational resources, how might this impact model choice?

Part 4: Reflection & Workflow Diagram (10 points)

Reflection (5 points):

What was the most challenging part of the workflow? Why?

How would you improve your approach with more time/resources?

Diagram (5 points):

Sketch a flowchart of the AI Development Workflow, labeling all stages.

Tip:Â Review lecture notes on preprocessing, evaluation metrics, and the CRISP-DM framework.

This assignment encourages holistic thinking about AI projects while emphasizing ethics and real-world constraints. Good luck! ðŸš€
